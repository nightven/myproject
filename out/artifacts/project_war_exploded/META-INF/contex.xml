<!-- maxActive: Maximum number of database connections in pool. Make sure you
     configure your mysqld max_connections large enough to handle
     all of your db connections. Set to -1 for no limit.
     -->

<!-- validationQuery= "SELECT 1": MySql SQL query used to validate connections
     from the pool before returning them to the caller
     -->

<!-- validationInterval: Used to avoid excess validation, only run
     validation at most at this frequency – time in milliseconds. If a connection
     is due for validation, but has been validated previously within this interval,
     it will not be validated again. The larger the value, the better the performance,
     but you increase the chance of a stale connection being presented to your application.
     -->

<!-- maxIdle: Maximum number of idle database connections to retain in pool.
     Set to -1 for no limit.  See also the DBCP documentation on this
     and the minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration parameter.
     -->

<!-- maxWait: Maximum time to wait for a database connection to become available
     in ms, in this example 10 seconds. An Exception is thrown if
     this timeout is exceeded.  Set to -1 to wait indefinitely.
     -->

<!-- initialSize:  The initial number of connections that are created when the pool is started
     -->

<!-- jmxEnabled:(boolean) Register the pool with JMX or not. The default value is true.
     -->

<!-- username and password: MySQL username and password for database connections  -->

<!-- driverClassName: Class name for the old mm.mysql JDBC driver is
     org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver - we recommend using Connector/J though.
     Class name for the official MySQL Connector/J driver is com.mysql.jdbc.Driver.
     -->

<!-- url: The JDBC connection url for connecting to your MySQL database.
